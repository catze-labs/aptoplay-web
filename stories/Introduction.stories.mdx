# APTOPLAY Storybook

> This is a storybook that collects components used in the demo of APTOPLAY.

## What is APTOPLAY?

<p>
  APTOPLAY is a submission work for the Aptos Seoul hackathon and is a compound
  word of APTOS + PLAY.
</p>

<p>
  Our project aims to create a seamless and user-friendly experience for game
  studios and developers in the Web3 space. By providing tools that prioritize
  player experience and ease of use, as well as integrating with popular game
  engines and allowing for social login, we aim to empower developers to create
  the best possible games.
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, we plan to develop a fully on-chain gaming backend solution on
  Aptos as part of our roadmap. Overall, our goal is to enable game studios to
  focus on what they do best, creating great games, by removing any friction and
  providing them with the necessary tools.
